# Claude Code automatise la conception d'évaluations et le hillclimbing

## Résumé

Anthropic ajoute deux commandes au skill claude-api : build-eval pour concevoir des évaluations robustes avec Claude Code, et hillclimb pour améliorer itérativement une application contre cette évaluation sans surapprentissage. L'article détaille les principes de bonne conception d'évals (éviter de sur-échantillonner les échecs d'un seul modèle, utiliser un grader validé par un humain) et les garde-fous anti-overfitting (split train/test, détection du bruit statistique, retour arrière si régression). Deux études de cas concrètes montrent des gains significatifs de précision et de coût.

## Idées clés

- Ne pas construire une évaluation uniquement à partir des échecs du modèle actuel, car cela mesure l'empreinte de faiblesse d'un modèle plutôt que la difficulté réelle de la tâche.
- Un cas doit être inclus dans l'éval seulement si un humain peut expliquer pourquoi il est difficile, avant de l'ajouter.
- Le trafic de production ne doit pas être une source aveugle de cas de test, car les utilisateurs testent souvent ce qu'ils pensent déjà fonctionnel, biaisant vers des cas faciles.
- Avant de croire un évaluateur automatique (grader), il faut lire un échantillon de transcriptions notées : les erreurs de notation sont une cause fréquente de mauvaise configuration des évals.
- Le hillclimbing sépare aléatoirement les données en train/test et rejette un patch si le score progresse sur train mais stagne sur test, signe de surapprentissage au harnais plutôt qu'à la tâche réelle.
- Avant chaque cycle d'amélioration, Claude vérifie que le bruit de mesure de l'éval est plus petit que le gain minimal recherché, sinon il recommande plus de répétitions/cas plutôt que de perdre du temps sur des changements non mesurables.
- Quand le score stagne, Claude classe les échecs restants par cause racine au lieu de continuer à patcher, ce qui permet de détecter des cas ambigus, des bugs du harnais ou de la simple variance.
- Étude de cas support client : passage d'Opus 4.8 à Sonnet 5 avec prompt nettoyé et règles de routage a fait passer la précision de 78,6% à 90,5% sur données tenues à l'écart, pour environ un cinquième du coût initial.

Principles for designing evals and hillclimbing against them without fooling yourself, and how the claude-api skill's build-eval and hillclimb commands put them to work.

Evaluations provide a signal on how your app or skill is performing on specific tasks. But designing evaluations, and improving performance on them without fooling yourself, is hard. We've added guidance for both to the claude-api skill.

With the skill, you can run `/claude-api build-eval` to build an evaluation inside your codebase, and run `/claude-api hillclimb` to improve your application against it, one change at a time, with a held-out set of examples to catch overfitting.

In this article, we highlight the principles of good eval design and hillclimbing first, then show how Claude Code with the `claude-api` skill applies those principles. We’ll close by showing a few examples of these commands.

Well designed evaluations have a few common elements (Figure 1):

Model capability is jagged. If you pick cases because today's model fails them, you are sampling the valleys of one model's capability surface (Figure 2). The evaluation can end up measuring that model's failure fingerprint rather than what is intrinsically hard or valuable for your application to do.

Pick hard cases because a human judged them hard: a useful test is to be able to say why a task is hard before you include it. Include cases that are specific failures in your application derived from production traffic, bug reports, or tickets. However, don’t blindly trust user traffic: users sometimes try what they expect to work, so a task distribution drawn strictly from user traffic may skew easy.

The `build-eval` command in the claude-api skill turns these principles into a guided workflow. When you run `/claude-api build-eval` in Claude Code, Claude interviews you, builds the eval inside your codebase, and pauses for approval at specific points.

Claude helps you sample inputs to build evaluations in this order:

The skill prioritizes production traffic, but it can also generate synthetic data anchored in a few real examples that you provide. The skill instructs Claude to generate a simple page that shows you every input and waits until you confirm them. As an illustration, below we show an example set of inputs for an e-mail router application that the skill may ask the user to review (Figure 3).

After the inputs, Claude proposes the cheapest grader that fits your application’s output:

Claude grades a handful of cases and asks whether you would have scored any of them differently (Figure 4). In general, it is important to read a sample of scored transcripts before believing your evaluator; scoring failures are among the most common ways an evaluation is misconfigured.

When you’ve validated the grader, the skill tells you the size of the evaluation set (cases × repeats × model, and roughly how long it will take), runs the baseline, and prints the score with a confidence interval. What you get back: the cases, the grader, the runner, one JSON line and one full transcript per case, and a plain page that lists each case's score with a link to its transcript. If you want more than that page shows (e.g., a chart), just ask and Claude will build it as an extra page next to it. By default, these extra pages are static files that open locally and load nothing from the network.

During the baseline runs mentioned above, Claude checks a number of things:

Now that you have a reliable means of grading your application’s performance on a task, you can try to improve it. Hillclimbing is an effective way to tune parameters like effort or prompts, which trade-off cost and performance. Some general tips for choosing where to apply it:

Even a well-designed evaluation rarely matches the exact task distribution you care about in production. As a result, "overfitting" to an evaluation is a common problem and results in a system that performs better on an evaluation than on production traffic.

There are many ways an evaluation can "leak" into your harness (the code around the model, including prompts, tools, and loop that calls Claude). For example, consider an evaluation task that benefits from OCR, but OCR is rarely beneficial in your production tasks. The evaluation harness might add an OCR tool to your application, which improves on the benchmark without any impact on production. More broadly, hillclimbing may add features to that harness that address edge cases in the particular evaluation examples you’ve chosen. These harness additions improve your evaluation score, but don’t translate to improvements in production (Figure 5).

Three things can help address this:

As discussed below, the claude-api skill applies these principles for you.

The hillclimb command in the claude-api skill turns these principles into a guided workflow. When you run `/claude-api hillclimb` in Claude Code, Claude iterates to improve against a given evaluation. You choose what changes it can make including:

Before it starts, Claude asks what you want to optimize (e.g., performance, or cost while performance holds) and then splits the evaluation set at random into test and train. With a cost goal, it considers a few common cost drivers, including prompt caching, auditing the prompt for compatibility with the selected model, and picking the model and effort setting.

Before the first round, Claude checks that the eval's noise (how far the score can move by chance alone) is smaller than the smallest improvement you'd act on; if it isn't, it says so and suggests more repetitions or cases.

Each round, Claude reads the previous round’s train transcripts and proposes one change as a patch. It aims each round at a change whose effect can show above the eval's noise: it fixes the failing behavior at its root (e.g., rewrites the section that causes it or adds a missing rule) rather than rewording a line. It then runs evaluation with the patched change. At this point, Claude applies a check: if the `train` set improves but the `test` set is flat, Claude suspects overfitting and reverts the patch. If there is a regression, Claude reverts. If train and test sets improve, it keeps the patch (Figure 6).

When the score stalls for two or three rounds, Claude reads each remaining train failure and sorts it by cause. It does the same early if no single fix could gain more than the eval's noise, and suggests more repetitions or cases, rather than spending rounds on changes too small to measure. This step can catch ambiguous evaluation cases, harness errors, or run-to-run variance.

Only legitimate failures are included in more hillclimbing rounds.

When hillclimbing completes, Claude leaves your code at the version that did best on the test set for your goal. It reports the test result against the baseline with confidence intervals (Figure 7). If the gain is within noise, it says so and recommends against merging.

We ran `/claude-api hillclimb` on an internal customer support benchmark with the goal of reducing cost and improving performance. The benchmark included 44 tickets, with 30 used for the search and 14 held out. It started on Opus 4.8 at default (high) effort settings with 74.4% decision accuracy on the search tickets and a token cost of 4.6 cents per ticket.

The hillclimb first audited the prompt, removing mandatory tool-call rituals, a scratchpad step, and contradictory rules. Then it tried Opus 5.5 on low effort. This cleared the baseline accuracy bar at 87.8% and cut cost to 1.9 cents per ticket, less than half the starting cost.

Part of that saving comes from Opus 5.5's pricing: input and output tokens cost 20% less than on Opus 4.8, and cache reads cost 60% less. Because Opus 5.5 cleared the bar, the hillclimb then stepped down a tier to check whether a cheaper model could clear it too. Sonnet 5 on low effort scored about the same, 88.9%, at about half the cost, 1 cent per ticket (Figure 8).

Finally, Claude improved the prompt with routing rules and a refund-cap cross-reference, bringing Sonnet 5 to 98.9% at about the same cost. On the 14 held-out tickets that the search never saw, the final configuration scored 90.5% against the original setup's 78.6%, at about one fifth of the cost.

Another example is our claude-api skill, which provides guidance on using our APIs and general tips for working with Claude (including the sub-commands discussed in this article). We want to ensure our skill can correctly implement code that uses our APIs, and we built an evaluation set derived from our documentation to test the skill.

On our evaluation, the skill started at 66%. We gave the hillclimber access to documentation and our SDKs, allowing Claude to identify errors and self-correct them (Figure 9). Claude found that the skill was missing coverage of eight features.

Adding sections for them in the skill improved performance to 74%. It then found errors in C# and Java type tables, boosting performance to 77%.

After the score stalled for two rounds, Claude analyzed the remaining failures and bucketed them by root-cause. A normal round makes one edit for the most common failure. This step makes no edit; it only sorts every remaining failure by cause. This reflection step was useful in a few ways:

These sub-commands can be used directly in Claude Code via the claude-api skill:

Run `/claude-api build-eval` if you want to generate an evaluation set for a particular problem. You can steer it by providing access to examples (e.g., traces). Claude will employ the guidance shared in this article to design the examples and grader, and ensure you approve the examples and the grader.

Run `/claude-api hillclimb` if you have an evaluation and want Claude to improve on this, guided by your goal (e.g., better performance, or lower cost while performance holds). Claude will employ the guidance shared in this article to check for overfitting while climbing and check for bugs in the eval itself, such as a grader that marks a correct-looking answer wrong or a harness error, both before the first round and whenever the score stalls.
